            <p>Hey..,,,<br>This is the stupid thought that i had that i told you about that day when you sent me the
                stuff for this semester, you probably don't remember it. I was thinking one day what to give you since
                you were going and i couldn't think of anything and didn't wanted to let you go like that cause i
                considered us atleast this close and this stupid thing came in my mind so uk why not. <br><br>

                I am not the person who does these kinda things and goes out of my way to meet people to make friends, I
                just be myself and whoever
                comes, comes. I spent my whole college life like that and that includes TPC. I had always known you like
                yeah you were there in college, never once even tried to talk to you and we were in TPC for a whole year
                before your headship. Never knew You. <br><br>

                And then you became head and we finally talked i guess for the first time. Still, it was all
                professional, only knew you as that popular girl (still won't accept that but yeah you were) and
                <b>"Soumya Ma'am"</b> and then those drives started and all those talks in TPC Room specifically that
                drive <b>Bc tum sb baat kyu nhi krte ho bol lia kro kuch</b> and <b> krlo help hoyegi tumhe</b>, yes
                that drive where you forced me out of my phone to interact and everyone in that room had the first
                impression of me like <b>hn bakchodi krta h fun h</b> and surprisingly you thought <b> I needed help or
                    something like that </b>and at the end i jokingly said <b>agr drive ke end tk rukwana h merko to
                    dekhlo pick and drop krna pdega</b> and you agreed and then you forced me in the very next drive
                <b>QUARK</b> the very first drive where we came to college with awkward silence and little talk. That
                was the day when shubhranshu asked me <b>Head bn na h terko</b> and i looked at you and said <b>Na, too
                    much work</b> and that was also the day you became my Designated Driver, oh no Driver sounded rude,
                you became my Chauffeur, this sounded good. <br><br>

                And then your Birthday came, My first ever drunk message to you which wasn't so bad was just a birthday
                wish with a very good peg. You were the one who helped me pick my color for the phone, i mean had picked
                it but uk needed a second opinion on that. And my first ever event came, Not gonna lie i was scared
                shitless that i'll mess up in front of all those juniors and fuck up everything. and there you were
                giving me pointers to control that stage freight. The things you told me to pack for roorkee, you
                probably do that for everyone but not a lot of people do that for me and those were the times when i
                started liking you as a person and yeah maybe we can be like actual friends. <br><br>

                And then we started talking at nights, you telling me things, things people said about you rumors, the
                fact that you hate being popular that you were forced to come out of that zone cause of TPC, the caption
                of your photos i laughed about and you defending yourself saying that you were just in 11th class. The
                drunk text of roorkee <b>DUDEEEEE</b> the very first time i accepted <b>I like talking to you</b> and
                since i was drunk you can trust that it was true. <br><br>

                Then came the Jagrata where you were not coming for some reasom but ended up being there. The day
                where we clicked our first ever picture and believe me just how shit those pics were, the worst and i
                drove your car for the first time cause you were tired and the driver roles reversed. and we sat at
                sukhna for looking at sunrise if i remember correctly and that was the first time i told you something
                personal. <br><br>

                You remember me telling you about that <b>DAM</b> which was a secluded place and you were like <b>bs ek
                    bar chli jau jagah dekhlu fir to akele jake baith jaugi itni kitni hi secluded hogi ye</b> and you
                were weirded out just by the fact that there was a car following us on a one way with no turns. and you
                trusted yourself with me in that place and my decisions in that place with those drunk people. That was
                the day where it felt like yeah maybe you also consider me as a actual friend not just a friend, if u
                know what i mean. <br><br>

                Then in PECFEST were our best photos, the day you irritated me with that <b>thoda upr kr thoda niche,
                    angle thik kr bc</b> and everywhere <b>tushar photo khichde</b> like personal photograper bnadia ho
                but yeah those were the 2 fun days where we roamed around clicked pictures. Uk i didn't had that good of
                a birthday, i only told you that once when you asked me kaisa jara and you said ghr jake that i had you
                irrespective it's a good day or bad day, and uk it was a good ending to that day atleast, and if i had
                to choose the best part of the day it would probably the moment we left college and went home. <br><br>

                I even trusted you with the important decisions like that time when you were asking everyone if they
                want to be head or not and i talked with you personally and told you that if u think i can do it add my
                name otherwise don't and see where i am right now <b>Head of TPC </b>and i wouldn't be here probably if
                i didn't trusted your decision cause if it was left to me i probably would have been scared of it also
                and uk <b>maine to dosti hi headship ke lie kri thi na</b> idiot.<br><br>

                Sooooooo, I'm really glad we started talking and became friends. Uk you went from <b>Soumya Ma'am
                    TPC</b> to <b>Soumya TPC</b> to <b>Soumya</b>. You are the only senior who i liked talking to and u
                remember u asked once, when i said i didn't liked talking to people that <b>when you'll sit in placement
                    and you will be nervous which senior would you call</b> i had no name in mind not a single one but
                now i have atleast one whose presence really does affect me and i hope it's vice-versa, and now I'm saying this to you <b>Don't you dare take a U-Turn from this
                    now.</b><br><br>

                Since, we have so many photos now, you might wanna consider one of them for that shadi ka
                card...............
